Ramda Repl
==========

A repl (read-eval-print-loop) for [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ramda/repl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ramda/repl)

---

### Usage

[dist/bundle.js](dist/bundle.js) will expose a global function called `ramdaRepl`.

`ramdaRepl` is applied to two arguments (details to follow) and will immediately attempt to instantiate itself in the DOM.

An example with all the configuration options set is available [here](example/index.html).

```js
ramdaRepl(target, config)
```

#### target

`target` is a reference to a DOM Node, such as you would get from `document.querySelector`:

```js
var target = document.querySelector('#my-text-area');
```

RamdaREPL will do the following operations with respect to the target DOM Node:

- it will hide the target node
- it will add itself to the DOM as a sibling to the target node
- it will look for text within the target node and will prefill the input panel with this text (this can be overridden by the config)

#### config

`config` is a regular JavaScript object.

The keys `ramdaScript` and `scripts` are used to organise the dynamically loaded scripts that will be available to the REPL, such as `ramda`, `ramda-sanctuary` and `ramda-fantasy`. Ramda is loaded first, as it is presumed that the other libraries will require it to be present before they can be included.

Organising the scripts includes providing a reference to a URL where the script can be sourced - and adding in optional configuration for how globals will be made available.

How the dynamically loaded scripts are made available can defined using objects with the following keys:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Required</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>src</code> </td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>A URL referencing a JavaScript file</td>
      <td>
        <pre lang="js">
"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/ramda/latest/ramda.min.js"
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>global</code></td>
      <td>Yes if <code>exposeAs</code> or <code>expose</code> are used </td>
      <td> String </td>
      <td> A name of a global the the script will introduce</td>
      <td>
        <pre lang="js">
"R"
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>exposeAs</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>The name of a global that will act as an alias to the global introduced by the script</td>
      <td>
        <pre lang="js">
"RAMDA"
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>expose</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Array of Strings</td>
      <td>A list of method names on the <code>global</code> that you wish to expose globally. <strong>Given this list is not provided all methods found on the <code>global</code> will be exposed</strong></td>
      <td>
        <pre lang="js">

  "identity",
  "map",
  "filter"

        </pre>

### Development

You will find a collection of [npm run *](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) scripts in [package.json](package.json):

To run a simple server that will host the [example/index.html](example/index.html) file:

```
npm run server
```

This will start serving the _repl_ at [localhost:8080/example](http://localhost:8080/example)

To build the JavaScript bundle:

```
npm run build
```

#### Watch modes

To build the JavaScript bundle when files change (with sourcemap support):

```
npm run watch-js
```

To build the CSS bundle when files change:

```
npm run watch-css
```

To watch both:

```
npm run watch
```

#### Testing / Linting

To run tests:

```
npm test
```

To lint the JavaScript:

```
npm run lint
```

#### Minification

The CSS is quite small and is minified while it is built.

The JavaScript is not minified by `npm run build-js` or `npm run watch-js` so those operations can run a little faster.

To minify the JavaScript:

```
npm run minify
```
